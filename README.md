This repository contains the assignments from my Python course, where I practice different concepts and coding exercises in Python.

Assignment 1: Python Basics Overview
This assignment covers Python fundamentals like syntax, variables, data structures (sets, dictionaries, tuples, lists), control flow with conditionals and loops, and the use of functions. It also includes exercises that combine these topics.

Assignment 2: Environments and Practical Exercises
This assignment focuses on environments and GitHub, with practical exercises like FizzBuzz, data filtering, a simple to-do list app, and a temperature converter.
